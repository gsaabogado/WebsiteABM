    "text": "Most of the data we use to feed our model comes from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). The SOEP is a representative longitudinal panel study that started in West Germany in 1984. The current version of the survey contains a large set of socio-demographic and economic characteristics of German households.\nThe SOEP is divided into different data files each containing different questionnaires – in this model, we use data from SOEP-37.\nThe main questionnaires we use for the construction of the model are:\n\n\nPEQUIV - Personal Equivalent File \\(\\rightarrow\\) (Documentation)\nHGEN - Household Generated Data File \\(\\rightarrow\\) (Documentation)\nHWEALTH - Household Wealth Questionaire\nHCONSUM - Household Consumption Module\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of our variables are loded in one of two R formats; numeric or haven-labeled. Haven labeled format is similar to STATA (or SPSS) labeled data (For more information we refer the reader to the online vignete of the haven package). The R-labeled class (part of the haven package) allows us to associate arbitrary labels to numeric or character vectors. Note that the goal of labeled files is only to include the description of categorical vectors in the SOEP data. For instance, when printing one labeled variable, the output consists of a vector of values alongside a data frame linking values and labels. It is essential to clarify that researchers must transform haven-labeled data formats into numeric or factor variables before using them in econometric, machine learning, or optimization models. Still, we keep the haven-labeled format in the raw files as it allows researchers to directly understand the values related to each numeric identifier of categorical variables in the SOEP data.\nAs an example, we show an example of the sex column in the pequiv file. The variable contains a title identifier Gender of Individual alongside a vector of numeric values (i.e., 2,1,2,1,1,2), and the data frame linking values to labels. Using this data-frame is easy to understand that all negative values are missing responses, one relates to male, and two to female respondents.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nhead(pequiv$sex)\n\n\n<labelled<double>[6]>: Gender of Individual\n[1] 2 1 2 1 1 2\n\nLabels:\n value                                                 label\n    -6 [-6] Fragebogenversion mit geaenderter Filterfuehrung\n    -5             [-5] In Fragebogenversion nicht enthalten\n    -4                     [-4] Unzulaessige Mehrfachantwort\n    -3                                     [-3] nicht valide\n    -2                                  [-2] trifft nicht zu\n    -1                                     [-1] keine Angabe\n     1                                            [1] Male 1\n     2                                          [2] Female 2\n\n\nTable 1 shows a sample of individual-level characteristics we extract from the PEQUIV file. It consists of 19 variables and 547704 observations between 2005 and 2018. Each variable is either in a numeric or haven-labeled format. The data frame contains the individual and household IDs (pid and hid) alongside the year of the interview (year). head is an indicator variable on the relationship between pid and the household head (1 = head, 2 = partner, 3 = child, 4 = relative, and 5 = non-relative). Because of panel attrition and specific research goals the SOEP continuously expands its sample; sample is a categorical variable indicating the SOEP sample of pid. For instance, a value of 1 for sample means that pid belongs to the original SOEP wave starting in west Germany in 1984, while a value of three implies that the observation belongs to the first sample of East Germany in 1990. age is the average age of pid, sex its gender (1 - Male; 2- Female), MaritalStatus its civil status (1 – Married, 2 – Single, 3 – Widowed, 4 – Divorced, 5 – Separated, 6/7 — Not with partner), and education the total years of education.\n\nIndividualSpatialEmploymentHousehold\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, head, sample, age, sex, MaritalStatus, education) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Individual characteristics from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    head \n    sample \n    age \n    sex \n    MaritalStatus \n    education \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    79 \n    2 \n    -1 \n    10.5 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    45 \n    1 \n    2 \n    18.0 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    47 \n    2 \n    1 \n    18.0 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    1 \n    59 \n    1 \n    -1 \n    -2.0 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    3 \n    1 \n    15 \n    1 \n    -1 \n    -1.0 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    3 \n    1 \n    9 \n    2 \n    -1 \n    -1.0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, state, region) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Spatial variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    state \n    region \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    11 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    11 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, employment, occupation, industry1, industry2) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Employment variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    employment \n    occupation \n    industry1 \n    industry2 \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2131 \n    9 \n    30 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    2331 \n    9 \n    27 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    -1 \n    -2 \n    -1 \n    -1 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    -1 \n    -2 \n    -1 \n    -1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, Npersons, Nkids, income, GrossIncome) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Household variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    Npersons \n    Nkids \n    income \n    GrossIncome \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    0 \n    7648 \n    209 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    0 \n    18800 \n    7550 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 includes data on the spatial location of the household. Because we are working with the open version of the SOEP, we can only identify the state and region where the household is located. Next, Table 3 contains employment-related covariates. employment is a dummy variable equal to one if the person is currently employed. occupation is the person’s occupation according to the International Classification of Occupations Code (ISCO). For instance, code 5160 refers to protective service workers. industry1 is a two-digit industry code based on ten categories (1 – Agriculture, 2 – Energy, 3 – Mining, 4 – Manufacturing, 5 – Construction, 6 – Trade, 7 – Transport, 8 – Bank and Insurance, 9 – Services). Finally, industry2 is the industry code according to the Nomenclature of Economic activities of the European Union (NECS). Finally, Table 4 includes a set of household-level controls we extract from the PEQUIV file. Npersons and Nkids are the number of persons and kids in the household, while income and GrossIncome are the household net and gross incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 shows a sample of household-level identifiers we extract from the HGEN file. The data-frame contains 34 variables and 213,595 observations across 40,852 spanning between 2005 and 2018. hid and year are analogous to the pequiv file. Owner is an indicator variable based on four categories (1 – Owner, 2 – Main Tenant, 3 – Sub-Tenant, 4 – Tenant, 5 – Living in a home). AcqMeans Captures the means of acquiring the house for owners and can take four values (1 – Bought from the Owner, 2 – Inheritance or gift, 3 – Bought or built new, 4 – Got back from the public property). FreeRent is a dummy variable equal to one if the family does not pay rent. YearMoved refers to the year the family moved to the household. HouseSize Is the size of the dwelling in square meters. HouseType1 can take eight values (1 – one person HH, 2 – Couple with children, 3 – Single parent, 4 – Couple with children < 16, 5 – Couple with children > 16, 6 – Couple with children <> 16, 7 – Multiple generation HH, 8 – Other combination.). HouseType2 includes a finer version of household typologies.\n\nHousehold IndentifiersHousehold InfrastructureHousehold EnergyHousehold Costs\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\nkbl(select(hgen, hid, year, owner, AcqMeans, FreeRent,YearMoved, HouseSize, HouseType1, HouseType2) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 5:  Household identifiers HGEN file \n \n  \n    hid \n    year \n    owner \n    AcqMeans \n    FreeRent \n    YearMoved \n    HouseSize \n    HouseType1 \n    HouseType2 \n  \n \n\n  \n    27 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n    1994 \n    43 \n    1 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    60 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    -2 \n    1994 \n    130 \n    4 \n    42 \n  \n  \n    94 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n    2002 \n    48 \n    1 \n    15 \n  \n  \n    124 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n    2002 \n    36 \n    1 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    159 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    -2 \n    1 \n    1990 \n    120 \n    1 \n    12 \n  \n  \n    167 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n    2000 \n    83 \n    5 \n    51 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\nkbl(select(hgen, hid, year, basement, garden, elevator, balcony) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 6:  Household identifiers HGEN file \n \n  \n    hid \n    year \n    basement \n    garden \n    elevator \n    balcony \n  \n \n\n  \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2 \n    -8 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    60 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    94 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    124 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    2 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    159 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    2 \n    -8 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    167 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\nkbl(select(hgen, hid, year, CentralFloorHeating, ThermalInsulation, DoubleGlazing, AlternativeEnergy, pv, boiler) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 7:  Household energy efficiency investments \n \n  \n    hid \n    year \n    CentralFloorHeating \n    ThermalInsulation \n    DoubleGlazing \n    AlternativeEnergy \n    pv \n    boiler \n  \n \n\n  \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    60 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    94 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    124 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    159 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    167 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    -8 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\nkbl(select(hgen, hid, year, PowerCosts, OtherUtilityCosts, GasCosts, WarmWaterCosts) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 8:  Household energy costs \n \n  \n    hid \n    year \n    PowerCosts \n    OtherUtilityCosts \n    GasCosts \n    WarmWaterCosts \n  \n \n\n  \n    27 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    20 \n    -5 \n    30 \n  \n  \n    60 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    -2 \n    -5 \n    -2 \n  \n  \n    94 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    77 \n    -5 \n    49 \n  \n  \n    124 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    42 \n    -5 \n    40 \n  \n  \n    159 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    -1 \n    -5 \n    -1 \n  \n  \n    167 \n    2005 \n    -8 \n    137 \n    -5 \n    5 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6 contains different infrastructure characteristics of the dwelling. All variables are indicator dummies of basement, garden, elevator, or balcony infrastructure. As with the pequiv file, all negative entries refer to missing values for different reasons, e.g., the question was not part of that year’s questionnaire or invalid answers.\nTable 7 includes a set of indicator variables regarding household investments in Energy infrastructure or appliances. The indicator variables come from answers to the question What amenities does your dwelling have? Does it have - central floor heating (CentralFloorHeating - 1984-2014), floor heating (FloorHeating - since 2014), thermal insulation in the facade, roof, or basement (ThermalInsulation - Since 2015), air conditioner (ac - Since 2007), solar energy system (pv - Since 2007), other alternative energy sources like geothermal or heat pump (AlternativeEnergy - Since 2009), boiler (boiler - 1991-2013), and windows with at least double glazing (DoubleGlazing - Since 2015).\nTable 8 includes a set of numeric variables on the household’s energy costs. WarmWaterCost contains the heating costs of tenants (What were the heating costs, including hot water, in the last calendar year?). Until 2013 (wave BD), the SOEP only surveyed heating costs for tenants. After 2013, it asked all SOEP individuals. In 2015 (wave BF), respondents stated their costs for different energy sources (district heating, gas, liquified gas, electricity, heating oil, coal, wood, biomass, solar, and geothermal) and whether they used them for heating, warm water, cooking, or electronic devices. This change decreased the WarmWaterCost variable in the BF wave vs. other years. PowerCosts is a numeric variable with the electricity costs (excluding heating when applicable) asked since 2010. The exact questionnaire question is; What were your electricity costs in the last calendar year? The SOEP only asks this question to tenants if they pay rent. However, from 2016, it asked all tenants whether they paid rent or not. GasCosts states the monthly costs of gas not used for heating in Euros. Gas costs were only collected in 2014 (wave BE). OtherUtilityCosts are answers to the question; how much did you pay in the last calendar year for water, garbage removal, street cleaning, and other additional costs not mentioned above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we load all the household level data-sets, we merge them and construct a final panel data of SOEP individuals between 2005 and 2018. The data set contains 298,133 observations across 70,427 individuals and 26,035 households. On average, each person remains in the panel 4.2 years. The data set contains 57 different variables (each of which is defined in the glossary section).\n\nIndividual covariatesEmploymentDwellingDwelling Charac.Energy EfficiencyEnergy Costs\n\n\n\n\nShow
