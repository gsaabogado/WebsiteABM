    "text": "In this section we describe at length the main characteristics and scientific processing of the data files we use in the ABM-REN model.\nThe section is divided into three main subsections:\n\nGerman Socio-Economic Panel Study\nConsumption data from the Deutscher Finanz Amt\nGallup data on environmental attitudes\n\n\n\nMost of the data we use to feed our model comes from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP); a representative longitudinal panel study that started in West Germany in 1984.\nThe SOEP is divided into different data files each containing different questionnaires – in this model, we use data from SOEP-37.\nThe main questionnaires we use for the construction of the model are:\n\n\nPEQUIV - Personal Equivalent File \\(\\rightarrow\\) (Documentation)\nHGEN - Household Generated Data File \\(\\rightarrow\\) (Documentation)\nHWEALTH - Household Wealth Questionaire\nHCONSUM - Household Consumption Module\n\n\n\n\nAll of our variables are loded in one of two R formats; numeric or haven-labeled. Haven labeled format is similar to STATA (or SPSS) labeled data (For more information we refer the reader to the online vignete of the haven package).\nThe R-labeled class (part of the haven package) allows us to associate arbitrary labels to numeric or character vectors. Note that the goal of labeled files is only to include the description of categorical vectors in the SOEP data. For instance, when printing one labeled variable, the output consists of a vector of values alongside a data frame linking values and labels. It is essential to clarify that researchers must transform haven-labeled data formats into numeric or factor variables before using them in econometric, machine learning, or optimization models. Still, we keep the haven-labeled format in the raw files as it allows researchers to directly understand the values related to each numeric identifier of categorical variables in the SOEP data.\nAs an example, we show the gender column in the pequiv file. The variable contains a title identifier Gender of Individual alongside a vector of numeric values (i.e., 2,1,2,1,1,2), and the data frame linking values to labels.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nhead(pequiv$sex)\n\n\n<labelled<double>[6]>: Gender of Individual\n[1] 2 1 2 1 1 2\n\nLabels:\n value                                                 label\n    -6 [-6] Fragebogenversion mit geaenderter Filterfuehrung\n    -5             [-5] In Fragebogenversion nicht enthalten\n    -4                     [-4] Unzulaessige Mehrfachantwort\n    -3                                     [-3] nicht valide\n    -2                                  [-2] trifft nicht zu\n    -1                                     [-1] keine Angabe\n     1                                            [1] Male 1\n     2                                          [2] Female 2\n\n\nAlso note that, in general, all negative entries refer to missing values for different reasons, e.g., the question was not part of that year’s questionnaire or invalid answers.\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows a sample of individual-level characteristics we extract from the PEQUIV file. It consists of 19 variables and 547,704 observations between 2005 and 2018. Each variable is either in a numeric or haven-labeled format. The data frame contains the individual and household IDs (pid and hid) alongside the year of the interview (year).\n\nhead is an indicator variable on the relationship between pid and the household head (1 = head, 2 = partner, 3 = child, 4 = relative, and 5 = non-relative).\nage is the average age of pid\nsex the sex (1 - Male; 2- Female) of pid\neducation the total years of education of pid\n\n\nIndividualSpatialEmploymentHousehold\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, head, sex, age, education) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Individual characteristics from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    head \n    sex \n    age \n    education \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2 \n    79 \n    10.5 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    1 \n    45 \n    18.0 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2 \n    47 \n    18.0 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    2 \n    1 \n    59 \n    -2.0 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    3 \n    1 \n    15 \n    -1.0 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    3 \n    2 \n    9 \n    -1.0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, state, region) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Spatial variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    state \n    region \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    11 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    11 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, employment, occupation, industry1) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Employment variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    employment \n    occupation \n    industry1 \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    2131 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    2331 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    0 \n    -2 \n    -2 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    -1 \n    -2 \n    -1 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    -1 \n    -2 \n    -1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(select(pequiv, pid, hid, year, Npersons, Nkids, income, GrossIncome) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Household variables from the PEQUIV file \n \n  \n    pid \n    hid \n    year \n    Npersons \n    Nkids \n    income \n    GrossIncome \n  \n \n\n  \n    201 \n    27 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    0 \n    7648 \n    209 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    60313 \n    2005 \n    1 \n    0 \n    18800 \n    7550 \n  \n  \n    602 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    603 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    604 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n  \n    605 \n    60 \n    2005 \n    4 \n    2 \n    47146 \n    68521 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 includes data on the spatial location of the household.

For instance, code 5,160 refers to protective service workers. industry1 is a two-digit industry code based on ten categories (1 – Agriculture, 2 – Energy, 3 – Mining, 4 – Manufacturing, 5 – Construction, 6 – Trade, 7 – Transport, 8 – Bank and Insurance, 9 – Services).\nTable 4 includes a set of household-level controls we extract from the PEQUIV file.

All variables are indicator dummies of basement, garden, elevator, or balcony infrastructure.\nTable 7 includes a set of indicator variables regarding household investments in Energy infrastructure or appliances. The indicator variables come from answers to the question What amenities does your dwelling have? Does it have - central floor heating (CentralFloorHeating - 1984-2014), floor heating (FloorHeating - since 2014), thermal insulation in the facade, roof, or basement (ThermalInsulation - Since 2015), air conditioner (ac - Since 2007), solar energy system (pv - Since 2007), other alternative energy sources like geothermal or heat pump (AlternativeEnergy - Since 2009), boiler (boiler - 1991-2013), or windows with at least double glazing (DoubleGlazing - Since 2015).\nTable 8 includes a set of numeric variables on the household’s energy costs:\n\nWarmWaterCost: contains the heating costs of tenants. The number comes from answers to the question What were the heating costs, including hot water, in the last calendar year?. Until 2013 (wave BD), the SOEP only surveyed heating costs for tenants. After 2013, it asked all SOEP individuals. In 2015 (wave BF), respondents stated their costs for different energy sources (district heating, gas, liquefied gas, electricity, heating oil, coal, wood, biomass, solar, and geothermal) and whether they used them for heating, warm water, cooking, or electronic devices. This change decreased the WarmWaterCost variable in the BF wave vs. other years.\nPowerCosts: is a numeric variable with the electricity costs (excluding heating when applicable) asked since 2010. The exact questionnaire question is; What were your electricity costs in the last calendar year? The SOEP only asks this question to tenants if they pay rent. However, from 2016, it asked all tenants whether they paid rent or not.\nGasCosts: states the monthly costs of gas not used for heating in Euros. Gas costs were only collected in 2014 (wave BE).\nOtherUtilityCosts: are answers to the question; how much did you pay in the last calendar year for water, garbage removal, street cleaning, and other additional costs not mentioned above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we load the hgen and pequiv files, we merge them and construct a final panel data of SOEP individuals between 2005 and 2018. The data set contains 547,704 observations across 112,745 individuals and 40,852 households. On average, each person remains in the panel 4.9 years. The data set contains 57 different variables (each of which is defined in the glossary section).\nWhen merging the household and individual-level data. We perform different checks and create additional variables.\n\nWe change all negative values (NAs) from the raw SOEP data to R NA format.\nTransform the indicator variables with “Ja” or “Nein”

The SOEP consumption module, or “hconsum,” was implemented as part of the 31st SOEP wave in 2010. The goal of hconsum is to allow researchers to understand the relationship between welfare, income, and disposable income – whereas consumption characterizes the actual current living standard, income describes the potential command over resources.\nUsually, consumption data takes one of two forms; consumption journals or representative surveys. The goal of consumption journals is to keep track of all daily expenditures across a cross-section of representative households to understand consumption patterns. Once there is enough data, researchers aggregate the items into categories to assess the main components of households’ income use. . Representative surveys, on the other hand, study typical consumption instead of consumption at a given time. The core idea is that asking for a relevant set of typical consumption goods can act as a good proxy for total consumption.\nIn the 2010 hconsum module, the SOEP adopted the idea of consumption goods to approximate total consumption.\n\n\n\n\nYearly ConsumptionConsumption ShareConsumption Share of income\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Divide into income deciles \ndata = mutate(data, decile = ntile(income, 10)) |> \n  mutate(decile = as_factor(decile))\n# Create the data for the plot\nplot= select(data, -total, -income, -owner) %>% \n  gather(var, value, -hid, -decile)%>% \n  left_join(., codebook, by = c(\"var\" = \"concept\")) |> group_by(decile, group) |> \n  summarise(value = mean(value)) |> \n  mutate(group = fct_reorder(factor(group), value, .desc = F))\n# Plot total expenditures by concept\nggplot(plot) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = decile, y = value, fill = group), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = T, option = \"E\") +\n  theme_economist() %+replace% theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Yearly consumption by concept in thousand euros (SOEP 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Divide into income deciles \ndata = mutate(data, decile = ntile(income, 10)) |> \n  mutate(decile = as_factor(decile))\n# Create the data for the plot\nplot = select(data, -total, -income, -owner) %>% \n  gather(var, value, -hid, -decile) %>% \n  left_join(., codebook, by = c(\"var\" = \"concept\")) |> group_by(decile, group) |> \n  summarise(value = mean(value)) |> group_by(decile) |> \n  mutate(share = (value/sum(value))*100)  |> \n  mutate(group = fct_reorder(factor(group), share, .desc = F))\n# Plot total expenditures by concept\nggplot(plot) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = decile, y = share, fill = group), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = T, option = \"E\") +\n  theme_economist() %+replace% theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Consumption share by concept (SOEP 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Divide into income deciles \ndata = mutate(data, decile = ntile(income, 10)) |> \n  mutate(decile = as_factor(decile))\n# Create the data for the plot\nplot = select(data, total, income, decile) |> \n  group_by(decile) |> \n  summarise(consumption = mean(total), income = mean(income)) |> \n  mutate(share = (consumption/income)*100)\n# Plot total expenditures by concept\nggplot(plot) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = decile, y = share, fill = share), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = F, option = \"E\", direction = -1) +\n  theme_economist() %+replace% \n  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.8), legend.title = element_text(hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\") + \n  guides(fill = guide_legend(str_wrap(\"Consumption Share of Income\", width = 10)))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Consumption share of income (SOEP 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we use the information on income and power cost from the sub-set of renters to look at the relationship between annual power costs and income. For this, we divide the data set into ten different income groups based on the deciles of the income distribution and estimate the average and standard deviation of income and power costs in each decile.\nTable 15 contains a sample of the final data. IncomeGroup refers to the income decile. IncAvg is the average yearly income in thousands of Euros. PowerCostAvg is the average yearly power bill in Euros. IncSD is the standard deviation of annual income. And PowerCostSd the analogous for power costs. Figure 4 contains the density (Log) function of annual Power Costs across different income deciles. As expected, the density is normally distributed with higher mean values for more wealthy households.\n\nData SetDescriptives\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Load Data\nfile = gsub(\"WebsiteABM\", \"\", getwd())\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"02_GenData/03_SoepFiles/IncomePowerDeciles.rds\"))\n# Show the table\nkbl(ungroup(data) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 15:  Energy Efficiency Technologies \n \n  \n    IncomeGroup \n    IncAvg \n    PowerCostAvg \n    IncSd \n    PowerCostSd \n  \n \n\n  \n    [ 0.0, 13.6) \n    10.13827 \n    636.0916 \n    2.187315 \n    330.0873 \n  \n  \n    [13.6, 20.4) \n    17.11669 \n    736.8999 \n    1.953851 \n    365.6021 \n  \n  \n    [20.4, 25.8) \n    23.17710 \n    822.1222 \n    1.546291 \n    443.9794 \n  \n  \n    [25.8, 30.9) \n    28.23839 \n    887.2933 \n    1.447322 \n    568.0897 \n  \n  \n    [30.9, 36.1) \n    33.42765 \n    920.2857 \n    1.523214 \n    449.2557 \n  \n  \n    [36.1, 42.0) \n    38.92149 \n    926.9687 \n    1.666120 \n    437.2922 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Density function of Power Costs across Income Deciles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assign the propensity to consume across SOEP income deciles, we use statistics from the German Central Bank (Deutsches Bundesbank). The Bank provides propensities to consume across twelve income categories. For instance, the propensity to consume for persons with monthly incomes between 900€ and 1,300€ is x% while for individuals between 10,000€ and 80,000€ y%. \nGiven that we initialize ABM-REN across income deciles, we map the consumption propensity data from the Bundesbank with the SOEP income distribution. Table 16 shows a mapping sample between the “Bank” categories and the SOEP income distribution. As an example, the first row shows that the category between zero€ and five hundred is within the zero and third percentile of the SOEP income distribution.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Load Data\nfile = gsub(\"WebsiteABM\", \"\", getwd())\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"02_GenData/03_SoepFiles/AmtMap.rds\")) |> arrange(LowPer, desc = T)\n# Show the table\nkbl(ungroup(data) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 16:  Energy Efficiency Technologies \n \n  \n    amt \n    LowAmt \n    HighAmt \n    LowPer \n    HighPer \n  \n \n\n  \n    [    0,  500) \n    0 \n    500 \n    0 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    [  500,  900) \n    500 \n    900 \n    3 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    [  900, 1300) \n    900 \n    1300 \n    8 \n    17 \n  \n  \n    [ 1300, 1500) \n    1300 \n    1500 \n    17 \n    21 \n  \n  \n    [ 1500, 1700) \n    1500 \n    1700 \n    21 \n    26 \n  \n  \n    [ 1700, 2000) \n    1700 \n    2000 \n    26 \n    34 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we use consumption data from the SOEP to approximate the propernsity to consume distribution for the different income categories of the Bundesbank.\n\nData SetDescriptives\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Load Data\nfile = gsub(\"WebsiteABM\", \"\", getwd())\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"02_GenData/03_SoepFiles/ConsumptionDeciles.rds\"))\n# Show the table\nkbl(ungroup(data) %>% head(.)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 17:  Energy Efficiency Technologies \n \n  \n    IncomeGroup \n    IncAvg \n    ConAvg \n    ConSd \n  \n \n\n  \n    [    0,  500) \n    327.1773 \n    4.792508 \n    2.588007 \n  \n  \n    [  500,  900) \n    733.1171 \n    4.768947 \n    1.795604 \n  \n  \n    [  900, 1300) \n    1117.5803 \n    5.578136 \n    2.453102 \n  \n  \n    [ 1300, 1500) \n    1401.2352 \n    6.536188 \n    3.793312 \n  \n  \n    [ 1500, 1700) \n    1600.1122 \n    6.587236 \n    2.379205 \n  \n  \n    [ 1700, 2000) \n    1849.5851 \n    7.423728 \n    3.834969 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Density function - propensity to consume across Bundesban income categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npid: This variable provides unique identification for each individual ever surveyed in the SOEP.\nhid: This variable links individuals to the households they were living in at the time of the interview.

Throughout the presentation, the expectation operator takes the household’s subjective distribution of profits given observable available information at \\(t\\), \\(Z_{it}\\). Now, the Feasibility operator (\\(F_{ht}\\)) is an indicator variable determining if it is possible for household \\(h\\) to install the PV system in the current dwelling. For instance, for households with short-term flat rents in the city center, it would likely be unfeasible to install a PV system.\nThe household’s utility also depends on social and environmental components. The social element \\(\\lambda_{ht}\\) is a continuous variable between zero and one, indicating the share of close-by neighbors with a PV installation. The network estimate incorporates evidence from the literature on behavioral economics and technology adoption regarding peers’ influence on peoples’ probability of adopting new technologies. The environmental component (\\(Env_{ht}\\)) captures the utility of investing in green technologies for persons with strong environmdsental preferences. For instance, even if the utility from elicited profits and network effects is negative, a share of the population would adopt green technologies because of environmental preferences.\nEach household elicits the profits from owning a PV (\\(p_{ht}\\)) by solving Equation 2. in it, \\(\\Delta_{ht}\\) is the expected energy the PV installation would generate for household \\(h\\) at time \\(t\\). This expectation depends positively on each individuals’ coefficient of risk aversion (\\(\\phi_i\\)), i.e., \\(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta_{it}}{\\partial \\phi_i} \\leq 0\\). Besides risk aversion, the coefficient also depends on individual characteristics \\((Z_{it})\\) like past consumption, age, income, and family size.\n\\[\n\\Pi_{ht} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\big[E(\\Delta_{ht}|\\phi_h, Z_{ht}) E(p_{ht}, Z_{ht}|\\phi_i) - K_t - I_{ht}|Z_{ht} \\big]\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\\(p_{ht}\\) represents household \\(h\\) expected grid-price of electricity. As with the expectation of energy production, the price depends on individual characteristics \\((Z_{it})\\) and the risk aversion parameter \\(\\phi_i\\) with \\(\\frac{\\partial p_{it}}{\\partial \\phi_i} \\leq 0\\). Next, \\(K_t\\) are the capital costs of the PV system at \\(t\\) and \\(I_{ht}\\) all costs related to bank loans in cases where the household is capital constrained. As with elicited future energy expenditures and prices, \\(I_{ht}\\) depends on observable household characteristics (\\(Z_{it}\\)), e.g., banks provide lower interest rates to wealthy individuals with steady jobs.\nAn individual only applies for a bank loan when their liquidity at \\(t\\) is lower than the costs associated with the installation of the PV system, i.e., \\(Loan_{it} = max(0, K_t - \\mu_{it})\\). Now, if the loan required to obtain a PV (\\(Loan_{it}\\)) is larger than the income of the household times a bank threshold multiplier (\\(y_{it} \\times \\sigma\\)), the loan is too risky for the banking institution, and even though household \\(h\\) elicits a positive utility from PV, it would not purchase the system because of capital constraints. When the banking institution provides the loan necessary to purchase the PV system, the cost of the loan is equal to \\(I_{it} = r + \\rho \\frac{Loan_{it}}{y_{it}}\\).\nThe liquidity of each household (\\(\\mu_{ht}\\)) evolves according to equation Equation 3.\n\\[\n\\mu_{it} =(1 - \\alpha_i^1) y_i + (1 - \\alpha_i^2)\\mu_{it-1} − (CE_i - PV_i  R^{PV})P_t - I_{it} Loan_{it} - \\gamma  Loan_i\n\\tag{3}\\]"

    "text": "Consumption\nEach household devotes a part its income to consumption expenditures (excluding electricity consumption which is determined as described above). The average propensity to consume of \\(h\\), \\(c^h_t\\), is determined using survey data from the German Federal Statistical Office, which gives household consumption expenditure by income group, converted into percentiles using the 2018 SOEP wave. \\(c^h_t\\) is hence the average propensity to consume of the income percentile in which \\(h\\) finds itself in period \\(t\\). The desired consumption expenditure of \\(h\\) is then given by\n\\[\n    C^h_t=(1-\\mu)C^h_{t-1}+\\mu c^h_t Y^{p,h}_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is a parameter giving the speed at which consumption expenditure adjusts. In the initial period, we set \\(C^h_t=c^h_t Y^{p,h}_t\\).\nEach household in the model holds a stock of liquid assets (money) which is augmented by income and can be used to consume, pay for electricity, and service debt. To update the liquidity of \\(h\\), we first calculate the difference between income on the one hand and desired consumption expenditure and electricity consumption on the other:\n\\[\n    Save^h_t=Y^h_t-C^h_t-p_t(E^h_t-PV^h_t G)\n\\]\nRecall that if \\(PV^h_t=1\\) and \\(E^h_t<G\\), the household generates more electricity using PV than it actually consumes, and it sells the excess to the grid at the current electricity price, \\(p_t\\).\nIn the first instance, \\(Save^h_t\\) is added to existing liquidity. Note that we assume that households cannot hold negative liquidity; if saving is negative and larger than previously accumulated liquidity, liquidity is set to 0 (implicitly assuming that the household reduces desired consumption expenditure and/or expenditure on electricity in order to be able to afford the payments):\n\\[\n    M^h_t=max\\left(0,M^h_{t-1}+Save^h_t\\right)\n\\]\nIn the model, households may incur debt in order to purchase a solar panel. At the beginning of the simulation, the debt of all households (including those already owning PV) is initialised to 0. In any period \\(t>0\\), households which in the past used a loan in order to buy PV and have not yet fully paid it off must make a debt service payment consisting of interest and principal payments, denoted by \\(S^h\\). \\(S^h\\) is determined when a household takes out a loan in order to adopt PV. Its calculation is explained in the description of the adoption decision below.\nPayments for debt service are made out of the stock of liquidity updated above:\n\\[\n    M^h_t=max\\left(0,M^h_t-S^h_t\\right)\n\\]\nNote that here, too, we assume that payments cannot lead to negative liquidity! If a household is unable to (fully) make its debt service payment out of liquidity, it pays as much as it can, making first the interest payment and then the principal payment. Unpaid principal payments mean that the stock of debt does not decrease as much as it would if the payment were made in full. Any unpaid interest payments are added to the household’s outstanding debt. In both of these cases, \\(S^h\\), i.e. the per-period debt service to be paid in the future is re-calculated taking into account unpaid principal and/or interest payments and the remaining term of the loan.\nIn a final step, we include a saving allocation choice. This is done to make sure that average household liquidity does not grow too fast. In particular we assume that\n\\[\n    M^h_t=M^h_{t-1}+\\theta^h_t(M^h_t-M^h_{t-1}) \\quad if\\ M^h_t>M^h_{t-1}\n\\]\ni.e. we assume that if the household has positive saving, it puts only part of this into liquid assets (bank deposits etc.). \\(\\theta^h_t\\) is set using Bundesbank data from which we calculate the share of liquid assets in median gross wealth by income group, such that \\(\\theta^h_t\\) is the corresponding share for the income percentile in which \\(h\\) finds itself in period \\(t\\).\nThe Initial value for liquidity is also set using these data, using median gross wealth and the share of liquid assets for the income group in which \\(h\\) starts out."

They attempt to learn them using the recursive least squares formula with constant gain:\n\\[\nR^h_t =R^h_{t-1}+\\gamma_h\\left(x_t x_t'-R^h_{t-1}\\right) n^h_t =n^h_{t-1}+\\gamma_h\\left(R^h_t\\right)^{-1}x_t(y_t-x_t' n^h_{t-1})\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_t\\) is the vector of independent variables (in our case, since we are estimating an AR(1) with intercept, this vector will contain the elements 1 and \\(\\Delta p_{t-1}\\)). \\(y_t\\) is the dependent variable in \\(t\\) (i.e. \\(\\Delta p_{t}\\)). \\(R^h_t\\) is \\(h\\)’s current estimate of the moment matrix of \\(x\\). \\(n^h_t\\) is \\(h\\)’s current estimate of the vector of parameters (intercept and AR parameter). \\(\\gamma_h\\) is the so-called gain parameter, which determines how sensitive \\(h\\)’s estimates are to new observations.\nEach household \\(h\\) hence has an internal AR(1) model with the parameters contained in \\(n^h_t\\).

    "section": "Adoption Decision",
    "text": "Adoption Decision\nThe decision on whether or not to adopt PV is based on a simple utility maximization framework; every household which does not already own a solar panel makes this decision in every simulation period. By assumption, there exists only one type of solar panel in the model, which has a fixed, uniform installation cost for every household and which generates a fixed, uniform amount of electricity (in kWh) in every period in which it is installed. The adoption decision is hence a binary one between adopting and not adopting.\nPrior to deciding whether or not to purchase a solar panel based on utility considerations, however, every household which does not already own PV must check whether they are financially capable of adopting. The uniform installation cost of a panel is given by \\(K\\). If the accumulated liquidity of household \\(h\\), \\(M^h_t\\) is greater than \\(K\\), \\(h\\) can buy a panel outright and proceeds to the utility maximisation problem. If \\(M^h_t<K\\), \\(h\\) must obtain a loan of size \\(L^h=K-M^h_t\\).\nBy assumption, the bank in the model sets a maximum amount which it is prepared to lend to any given household \\(h\\), which is determined by \\(LTV\\cdot K\\) where \\(LTV<1\\) i.e. it is a fraction of the cost of the panel. If \\(L^h>LTV\\cdot K\\), the household cannot obtain a loan of sufficient size; they are credit-rationed and cannot adopt. If they pass the first check, the bank also checks whether the household is financially capable of meeting the payments on a loan of size \\(L^h\\). The interest rate which the bank would charge on a loan to \\(h\\) is given by\n\\[\n    r_h=r+\\iota \\frac{L^h}{LTV\\cdot K}\n\\]\ni.e. the interest rate charged by the bank increases with the loan to value ratio implied by the loan. Given that loans in the model are assumed to be amortising, and assuming that all loans in the model have a duration equal to the lifetime of a panel, \\(A\\), the per-period payment on a loan of size \\(L^h\\) at rate \\(r_h\\) would be\n\\[\n    S^h=L^h\\frac{r_h(1+r_h)^A}{(1+r_h)^A-1}\n\\]\nIf \\(S_h\\) exceeds a fraction \\(DTI\\) of the current income of \\(h\\), i.e. if \\(\\frac{S^h}{Y^h_t}>DTI\\) the household is also credit-rationed and cannot adopt. Otherwise, they proceed to the utility maximisation problem.\nComing to the utility maximisation part of the adoption decision, we assume that\n\\[\n    U^{PV=0}_{h,t}=0 \\quad \\forall\\  h \\in H \\ \\& \\ \\forall\\  t \\in T\n\\]\ni.e. the utility from not adopting PV is always zero for all households. This means that a household will adopt as soon as the utility from doing so is greater than zero (provided that they are not credit-constrained as described above). The utility from adopting is given by\n\\[\n    U_{h,t}^{PV = 1} | (F_{h}=1) = E_{h,t}(\\Pi_h)+\\alpha_h \\lambda_{h,t}+\\beta Env_{h} ---\n    U_{h,t}^{PV = 1} | (F_{h}=0) =0\n\\]\nFirst of all, note that \\(U_{h,t}^{PV = 1}\\) is conditional on \\(F_{h}\\). \\(F_{h}\\) is a dummy denoting the feasibility of PV, i.e. whether, given the characteristics of the dwelling of household \\(h\\), a solar panel can in fact be installed. If \\(F_{h}=0\\), PV cannot be installed and the utility, correspondingly, is zero. At present, \\(F_h\\) is set for each household at the beginning of the simulation and remains fixed thereafter. If a household already owns PV at the beginning, it is set to 1. Otherwise it is set to 1 with probability \\(p^f_1\\) if the household lives in a house and with probability \\(p^f_2<p^f_1\\) if the household lives in a flat.\nFocus now on the case of \\(F_h=1\\). Going from right to left, the term \\(\\beta Env_{h}\\) captures the environmental attitude of the household. \\(Env_h\\) is a random number drawn from \\(\\mathcal{U}(0,1)\\) for each household at the beginning of the simulation, which remains fixed thereafter. It is supposed to reflect the intrinsic utility which \\(h\\) derives from owning PV regardless of whether or not it is profitable to do so.\n\\(\\alpha_h \\lambda_{h,t}\\) captures the element of social influence/emulation, where\n\\[\n    \\lambda_{h,t}=\\omega^{PV=1}_{d=d_h, t-1}-\\omega^{PV=0}_{d=d_h, t-1}\n\\]\n\\(\\omega^{PV=1}_{d=d_h, t-1}\\) is the share of households in the same income decile as \\(h\\) who owned PV at the end of the previous period, with \\(\\omega^{PV=0}_{d=d_h, t-1}\\) being the share of households in the same decile who own PV. \\(\\lambda_{h,t}\\) hence takes a value between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\nFinally, the term \\(E_{h,t}(\\Pi_h)\\) denotes \\(h\\)’s expectation at time \\(t\\) of the profit, \\(\\Pi_h\\) which \\(h\\) will be able to derive from owning PV over the lifetime of a panel. This expected profit is given by:\n\\[\n    E_{h,t}(\\Pi_h)=\\sum_{a = 1}^{A}\\rho_h^a E_{h,t}(p_{t+a})G-K-I^h\n\\]\n\\(\\sum_{a = 1}^{A}E_{h,t}(p_{t+a})G\\) is the expected revenue generated by the panel, obtained by multiplying the expected electricity price in every future period from \\(t+1\\) to \\(t+A\\) by the fixed capacity of the panel and taking the sum. This expected revenue is discounted by the individual discount rate of \\(h\\), \\(\\rho_h\\). Recall that, by assumption, households can buy and sell electricity from/to the grid at the same price. It hence makes no difference whether \\(G\\) is greater or smaller than the actual average electricity consumption of \\(h\\); if the panel will generate excess electricity, \\(h\\) expects to be able to sell this to the grid at the expected price.\n\\(K\\) is the fixed installation cost of the panel, which is the same for every household.\n\\(I^h\\), finally, is the financing cost of the panel. If no loan is needed (first case above), the loan cost is obviously 0. If a loan is needed, the cost is equal to the discounted sum of interest payments which will have to be made over the entire term of the loan. As set out above, the interest rate on the loan is given by\n\\[\n    r_h=r+\\iota \\frac{L^h}{LTV\\cdot K}\n\\]\nfrom which we can calculate a per-period loan payment as\n\\[\n    S^h=L^h\\frac{r_h(1+r_h)^A}{(1+r_h)^A-1}\n\\]\nKnowing the principal and per-period payment, we can calculate an amortisation schedule telling us how much principal and interest the household will have to pay in each future period, which in turn allows us to derive the loan cost as the discounted sum of future interest payments (note that principal payments are not a cost as they do not affect net worth!).\nSince loans are not costless, it is possible that even if the discounted expected revenue from owning a panel exceeds the installation cost, overall expected profit may turn negative due to the implied financing cost!\nThe household sums up all three elements of utility (expected profit, social influence, environmental attitude) and if that sum is positive, it adopts PV. Any loan taken out to do so is added to their balance sheet."
